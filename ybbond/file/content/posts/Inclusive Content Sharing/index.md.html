<a href="#l3" class="line" id="l3">      3</a> author: Yohanes Bandung Bondowoso
<a href="#l4" class="line" id="l4">      4</a> description: In this quick post, I talk about how complicated this world is, more with the internet. The main premise is about thinking twice before sharing a link or image. But in the end, you cannot (or it is hard to) please everyone.

<a href="#l15" class="line" id="l15">     15</a> ---
<a href="#l16" class="line" id="l16">     16</a> 
<a href="#l17" class="line" id="l17">     17</a> This is a complicated world. Each individuals are different, and there are many factors to consider while interacting with others. People who don&#39;t eat pork, or won&#39;t eat meat. People who fond of talking about ghost, and the ones easily scared. You must leave the toilet seat closed in some house, in some others opened.
<a href="#l18" class="line" id="l18">     18</a> 
<a href="#l19" class="line" id="l19">     19</a> Internet adds to that complexity. For instance you share a cute picture of a snake. There may be someone having _Ophidiophobia_[^1] who will block you. Not because they hate you, but only to get rid of that &quot;horrible picture&quot; of a scary creature.
<a href="#l20" class="line" id="l20">     20</a> 
<a href="#l21" class="line" id="l21">     21</a> ## On Inclusivity
<a href="#l22" class="line" id="l22">     22</a> 
<a href="#l23" class="line" id="l23">     23</a> The awareness of inclusivity had spread wider day by day. There is **Inclusive Design**, which concepts encourage you to think about **diversity** and **accessibility** when building products.
<a href="#l24" class="line" id="l24">     24</a> 
<a href="#l25" class="line" id="l25">     25</a> Example of diversity: provide more gender dropdown choice knowing some people won&#39;t feel comfortable sharing their gender.
<a href="#l26" class="line" id="l26">     26</a> 
<a href="#l27" class="line" id="l27">     27</a> ![Image courtesy of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sarahdopp.com/blog/2010/designing-a-better-drop-down-menu-for-gender/&quot;&gt;post from Sarah Dopp&lt;/a&gt;](gender-selection.png)
<a href="#l28" class="line" id="l28">     28</a> 
<a href="#l29" class="line" id="l29">     29</a> Example of accessibility: make your website content recognizable by text-to-speech software for those having difficulties reading. Other example of accessibility: provide certain color scheme on video game&#39;s User Interface, for those having difficulties differentiating certain colors.
<a href="#l30" class="line" id="l30">     30</a> 
<a href="#l31" class="line" id="l31">     31</a> ## Content Sharing
<a href="#l32" class="line" id="l32">     32</a> 
<a href="#l33" class="line" id="l33">     33</a> Back to the topic of content sharing. I gave you example about sharing picture of animal that some people may find disturbing. That is one thing.
<a href="#l34" class="line" id="l34">     34</a> 
<a href="#l35" class="line" id="l35">     35</a> Other thing is to think about individuals that do extra effort to conceal their **privacy**, even from Google[^2].
<a href="#l36" class="line" id="l36">     36</a> 
<a href="#l37" class="line" id="l37">     37</a> What is it about Google? Well, some people believe that accessing Google&#39;s domains or endpoints may give off their privacy to that company. The obvious example is using Google Analytics for any website[^3]. That practice may give off visitors&#39; data to Google. Other example is using Google Fonts, or embedding Youtube videos. Extreme example is linking a text to Youtube, like how I did in some of my posts.

<a href="#l41" class="line" id="l41">     41</a> ![Changed those to Invidious](youtube-invidious.gif &quot;Changed those to Invidious&quot;)
<a href="#l42" class="line" id="l42">     42</a> 
<a href="#l43" class="line" id="l43">     43</a> I replaced the links to [Invidio.us](https://invidio.us) though. Hope that helps.
<a href="#l44" class="line" id="l44">     44</a> 
<a href="#l45" class="line" id="l45">     45</a> So we talked about disturbing content and privacy. I am also thinking about **content availability**. The example is sharing great content that some people may not be able to retrieve, because it is hidden behind paywall. The example is some content on Medium, or NYTimes.
<a href="#l46" class="line" id="l46">     46</a> 
<a href="#l47" class="line" id="l47">     47</a> I often encounter this on Hacker News, where the linked content is a paywalled post on Medium, or NYTimes. There is a work-around for this, and I know maybe that great content only available on that certain platform.

<a href="#l49" class="line" id="l49">     49</a> ![GIF animation of Medium Paywall, also an irony](medium-paywall.gif &quot;GIF animation of Medium Paywall, also an irony&quot;)
<a href="#l50" class="line" id="l50">     50</a> 
<a href="#l51" class="line" id="l51">     51</a> I train myself to take some time searching whether that post shared elsewhere and share the alternative link instead.
<a href="#l52" class="line" id="l52">     52</a> 
<a href="#l53" class="line" id="l53">     53</a> ## Conclusion
<a href="#l54" class="line" id="l54">     54</a> 
<a href="#l55" class="line" id="l55">     55</a> &gt; You cannot please everyone.
<a href="#l56" class="line" id="l56">     56</a> 
<a href="#l57" class="line" id="l57">     57</a> The topics I&#39;ve written are not all. Others may think other factors they find necessary to consider before writing post or sharing links on the internet.
<a href="#l58" class="line" id="l58">     58</a> 
<a href="#l59" class="line" id="l59">     59</a> Easier written than said, even more done.
<a href="#l60" class="line" id="l60">     60</a> 
<a href="#l61" class="line" id="l61">     61</a> Sometimes I forget about some factors, and I am willing to be stand corrected for that. Thank you for all of you taking your precious time for reminding me. Truly appreciate your good intention.
<a href="#l62" class="line" id="l62">     62</a> 
<a href="#l63" class="line" id="l63">     63</a> As a closing statement, this is a complicated world. I can be a simpleton and ignoring all those complexity, but I choose the option I think making this world a more pleasant place to live. For me, and others.
<a href="#l64" class="line" id="l64">     64</a>
