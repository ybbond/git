 I installed the trial version on Mac. The main takeaway is iA Writer give the writer full control of its edited file. It uses iCloud to sync between devices. Mac version also has file versioning similar to _Time Machine_. iA Writer also supports opening external folder, enabling me to edit markdown file from my GitHub Gist.

 The app supports _focus mode_, which consists of _typewriter mode_ similar to Ulysses&#39; and [syntax highlighting](https://ia.net/topics/ia5_writer_features/syntax-highlight) that unique to iA Writer. The latter feature sounds unnecessary to me, because I thought highlighting non-code text will distracts me more than it helps me. I tried writing with _syntax highlighting_ on, and I realized it helps choosing good words and/or &#39;refactoring&#39; the written text. The app&#39;s website has good [blog posts](https://ia.net/writer/support/writing-tips/parts-of-speech) that give tips to write well.

</a><a href="#h5-0-49" id="h5-0-49" class="i">+This keyboard helped me boost my productivity in two areas. I am able to write on iPad. I can also also type faster on MacBook Pro, which butterfly keys had shown its infamous issue since 3 months ago. I can say that this _kickstarter_ keyboard helps to _kickstart_ my productivity. See what I did there? Kickstart?
