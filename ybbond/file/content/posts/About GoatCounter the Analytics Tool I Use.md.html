<a href="#l5" class="line" id="l5">      5</a> description: I implemented a good, privacy-respecting web analytics for this website since May the 20th. It is called GoatCounter. I try to explain and reason about it.

<a href="#l12" class="line" id="l12">     12</a> 
<a href="#l13" class="line" id="l13">     13</a> I like to develop website. I also like to write blogs, poems, post mortem, thoughts, tutorial, anything. I enjoy doing those things that even if I cannot publish (some of) them, I&#39;ve got more experience and I feel good.
<a href="#l14" class="line" id="l14">     14</a> 
<a href="#l15" class="line" id="l15">     15</a> But.
<a href="#l16" class="line" id="l16">     16</a> 
<a href="#l17" class="line" id="l17">     17</a> Let&#39;s be real here. I have itches. Curiosity. Social needs? Maybe, but I try avoid social media, or [silo](https://indieweb.org/silo) ‚Äî as the IndieWeb folks call it. I try to serve this site keeping my ethic[^1] and readers&#39; privacy. I also want to know whether anyone read my posts, and I want my works to be assessed by fellow readers. The assessment can be as simple as likes and thumb-ups (Luke Smith hilariously calls them _upcummies_[^2]). The assessment can also be comments or text feedbacks, this is what I prefer the most.
<a href="#l18" class="line" id="l18">     18</a> 
<a href="#l19" class="line" id="l19">     19</a> With the stuff I just told you in mind, I decided that I will implement analytic[^3] and response system to this site. So I researched for the tools. The main requirements are lightweight and respects users&#39; privacy.
<a href="#l20" class="line" id="l20">     20</a> 
<a href="#l21" class="line" id="l21">     21</a> For the response system, I found [WebMention](https://webmention.io/), which leads me to know more about [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org). The current candidate for the direct commenting system is [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/). The first I implemented is web analytics. Already suggested in this post&#39;s title, I use GoatCounter.

<a href="#l23" class="line" id="l23">     23</a> ## About GoatCounter
<a href="#l24" class="line" id="l24">     24</a> 
<a href="#l25" class="line" id="l25">     25</a> [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) is web analytics by Martin Tournoij or [arp242](https://www.arp242.net/goatcounter.html). It is lightweight, it is easy to implement, and it **respects users&#39; privacy**. See its privacy policy [here](https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy).
<a href="#l26" class="line" id="l26">     26</a> 
<a href="#l27" class="line" id="l27">     27</a> One embarassing thing is that I follow Martin&#39;s RSS Feed for so long, but I didn&#39;t read about his latest project. Before GoatCounter, I tried [StatCounter](https://statcounter.com) and opted-out shortly because I think the settings page is clumsy. I searched for another good alternatives that results none. Just last monday I see Martin published a new post about GoatCounter update. I decided to check it and that day, I tried GoatCounter.
<a href="#l28" class="line" id="l28">     28</a> 
<a href="#l29" class="line" id="l29">     29</a> You can see my instance of GoatCounter on [stats.ybbond.dev](https://stats.ybbond.dev/)!
<a href="#l30" class="line" id="l30">     30</a> 
<a href="#l31" class="line" id="l31">     31</a> I made it open for everyone and set obvious statement down in the footer, because I think however small the data I take from user visits, the users should be able to know about it.

<a href="#l35" class="line" id="l35">     35</a> [^1]: A good post from iA, _&quot;Ethics&quot; and Ethics_ by **Oliver Reichenstein**. [Read it here](https://ia.net/topics/ethics-and-ethics) on their site.
<a href="#l36" class="line" id="l36">     36</a> [^2]: Reference is from video _Social Media: Anything for Upcummies! ‚¨ÜüçÜüí¶üí¶_ by **Luke Smith**. You can [watch it here](https://youtu.be/YjbyDU0WzYI?t=48) on YouTube.
<a href="#l37" class="line" id="l37">     37</a> [^3]: I even stated in my [post](/posts/2020-04-migrating-my-blog-to-hugo/#current-features) about migrating to Hugo that I will implement _tracker_.
