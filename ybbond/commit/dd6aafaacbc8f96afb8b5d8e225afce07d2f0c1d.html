 I use all of Bear, iA Writer (on Mac) and iVim for a while, eliminated Bear because of its low I mentioned above, and feel that the lack of preview makes iVim lacky. I read from reddit and other &quot;this app vs. that app&quot; posts that iA Writer for iOS is a worth buy. I decided to try purchasing iA Writer for iOS.

 I read an interesting article (from a website that features a great function to see its articles&#39; revisions) about using GitHub Gist as a Blogging CMS. Here is [the post](https://bit.ly/2UForoW).
 
 Back then, my website was written in ReasonReact, and back then, I thought that implementing my own blog by fetching my Gist is a nice way to learn `bs-fetch` and `bs-json`.
