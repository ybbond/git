<a href="#h0-0-3" id="h0-0-3" class="i">+&gt; **Update**
</a><a href="#h0-0-4" id="h0-0-4" class="i">+&gt; NuPhy released firmware release for this keyboard that can be downloaded in their website. [Click here for the download page][firmware].

</a> I backed a project in [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nuphy/nutype-revolutionizing-the-laptop-typing-experience) in January 2020. The project planned to create Bluetooth Mechanical keyboard that can be placed on top of Macbook&#39;s keyboard. I backed as an **Early Bird** backer, it costs me $89 and _Jenius_ charged me Rp980263. The waiting was interesting and then became worrying when the Covid-19 outbreak happened. I received the keyboard in late March, the DHL guy delivered it to my house and my father sprayed the package with disinfectant immediately.
  
 I enjoyed and genuinely happy that I have my first bluetooth mechanical keyboard. If you read my [previous](/posts/2020-03-in-search-of-good-writing-app-bear-vs-ulysses/) blog [posts](/posts/2020-04-in-search-of-good-writing-app-part-2-ia-writer-vs-ivim/), you&#39;d know that I have utilized this keyboard to write blog posts and journal on my iPad.
 
 ## Aesthetic and Build
 
<a href="#h0-0-15" id="h0-0-15" class="d">-My first Mechanical Keyboard is Ducky One Mini 60%, a gift from my colleagues when I resigned from that office. They know that I never use arrow button, and rarely use mouse. The Ducky is compact enough and bringing it in my commuting from and to office is not a burden. The NuType F1 is even more compact, considering it has physical arrow keys.

</a> 
 I haven&#39;t tested bringing it with me anywhere as this is a &quot;Stay At Home&quot; era. Nevertheless, I often bring it with my iPad to any part of my house with no hassle.

 **NuType F1** uses Kaihua Choc switches, and I ordered the white switch, because they claimed it is the most noisy. I like noisy keyboards, the people around me don&#39;t.
 
<a href="#h0-1-3" id="h0-1-3" class="d">-Typing on this keyboard is overall convenient. If I can compare, trying NuType F1 after Ducky One Mini feels like trying MacBook&#39;s butterfly keyboard after the scissor switch. The switches are short in travel, but it feels tactile. The key has flat surface, and sliding my fingers on top of them feels smooth.

 Unfortunately this keyboard only use one switch for its space bar. Sometimes I fail to press the `Space` key if I press it at the left or right edge.

</a><a href="#h0-1-9" id="h0-1-9" class="i">+&gt; As stated above, new firmware update fixes the issue I wrote below.

</a> I also complains about the upper-left most key, that is the `Esc` key. The **NuPhy** team made the decision to make the escape as the main key, and you need to press `Fn` with `Esc` to trigger back tick, or `Fn` with `Shift` and `Esc` to trigger tilde `~`. I hardly press escape key. As a JavaScript developer, I press back tick more often for `string literal`. I also need back tick to make `code` text formatting when I write MarkDown or in Slack.
 
 ## Overall
 
 This keyboard helped me boost my productivity in two areas. I am able to write on iPad. I can also also type faster on MacBook Pro, which butterfly keys had shown its infamous issue since 3 months ago. I can say that this _kickstarter_ keyboard helps to _kickstart_ my productivity. See what I did there? Kickstart?
