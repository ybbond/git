 In the start of 2020, I planned to expand my [personal page](https://old.ybbond.dev/) to not only contain my &quot;CV&quot;, but also use it as my blog. That webpage is created with ReactJS, and my original idea was to make a new page that fetch data from GitHub Gist, then parse the MarkDown file to HTML file[^1]. I also planned (and I will not drop this one, for the sake of learning) to make that webpage server rendered.

 After 20% progress of making MarkDown to HTML parser, I got tired. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I thought that my time can be used to write my blog. So I researched for a static site generator. My primary writing tool, iA Writer boasts that it supports **Ghost**, **Wordpress** and **Medium**. I omitted Medium because I want to self-host the site. I omitted Wordpress too, because I am not too good at PHP Language. Then I try searching for Ghost, turns out it&#39;s a paid service.
